## Versioning Policy

MCP4H documents (Manifesto, Whitepaper, and related drafts) follow a simple versioning scheme:
- v0.x → Draft and exploratory versions (early working papers, preprints).
- v1.0 → First stable/public release (e.g., after acceptance to a preprint server).
- v1.x → Minor updates, clarifications, or editorial changes.
- v2.0+ → Major revisions or expansions (e.g., protocol updates, prototype integration).

All official releases are archived on Zenodo and linked with a DOI.
For the most up-to-date working versions, see the /docs/ folder in this repository.

## 🗂️ Archived Versions
Older drafts and superseded releases are preserved in the [`archived/`](./archived/) folder for reference.  
They are kept for **traceability and DOI consistency** (e.g., Zenodo releases).

**Note:** Always cite the DOI listed in the root project `README.md` or Zenodo release page when referencing MCP4H.
