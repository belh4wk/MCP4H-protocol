# MCP4H Patent Pledge (Early Draft)
We irrevocably pledge not to assert any patents we own that are necessarily infringed by a conforming implementation of the MCP4H v0.x specifications against developers, users, or distributors of such implementations, except against those who initiate patent litigation alleging infringement by MCP4H implementations.
