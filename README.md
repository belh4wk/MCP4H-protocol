# MCP4H – Multimodal Communication Protocol for Humanity

![MCP4H Flow](docs/diagrams/mcp4h_flow.svg)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1060606240.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17164549)

**MCP4H** is an open exploration into the future of communication:  
a universal, human-first protocol combining **Text, Audio, Visuals, and Haptics** into a resilient "4-Point Harness" for understanding. 
A neutral protocol for unifying multimodal signals between humans and machines.
Originating in simracing and Arduino DIY builds, it provides a consistent schema for telemetry, haptics, voice, and beyond.

## Where MCP4H Lives

To make MCP4H accessible, citable, and transparent, we’ve deposited it across multiple open platforms:

| Platform   | Purpose                                | Why it matters for MCP4H |
|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Zenodo (DOI)** | Open-access repository by CERN | Gives MCP4H a permanent, citable DOI in the scientific record |
| **ORCID** | Global researcher ID system | Ensures MCP4H is tied to my authorship long-term |
| **GitHub** | Open-source code/documentation hub | Makes MCP4H transparent, forkable, and open for collaboration |
| **HAL** | French national open archive | Adds archival legitimacy within the European academic ecosystem |
| **OSF** | Open Science Framework repository | Signals reproducibility and methodological transparency |
| **ResearchGate** | Academic social network (application pending) | Boosts peer visibility and informal uptake |
| **Figshare** | Open repository for data/figures (skipped for now) | Redundant with Zenodo DOI, but strong for dataset sharing |

This repo serves as a working space for the **manifesto, whitepaper, and technical exploration** of MCP4H.

## 🌍 Vision
Humanity’s greatest challenge is often **miscommunication**.  
MCP4H aims to create a foundation where meaning can travel across:
- Languages
- Cultures
- Modalities (voice, text, visual, haptic)
- Eventually, between **humans and machines**

Our goal: **clarity, empathy, speed, and trust** — built into a shared protocol,  
just as the 3-point seatbelt became a universal safety standard.
