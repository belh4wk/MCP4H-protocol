# MCP4H

**Multimodal Communications Protocol for Humans (MCP4H)**  
*A translation layer for signals â€” not another app, not another silo.*

MCP4H defines a **grammar of attention**: a common way to express cues so they land clearly, at the right time, through the right channel.

- **Type**: Coach, Risk, Plan, State, Confirm  
- **Priority**: now, soon, later  
- **Channel**: light, haptic, text, audio, or all  
- **Rules**: expiry + acknowledgement

Think of MCP4H as the **referee, not another player**. It doesnâ€™t add more noise â€” it decides *what matters, when to deliver it, and how to make sure it lands*.

## Proving grounds

- **Conversations**: via a custom GPT (*MCP4H: Harmonizer*). Keeps tone aligned, distills tangents into cues, nudges constructive habits.  
- **(Sim)Racing**: tested as an extra race engineer. Turns raw telemetry into cues like:  
  - `tyre hot` â†’ more grip, but risk of overheating  
  - `tyre cold` â†’ less grip, unstable  
  - `brake fade risk` â†’ adjust before failure  

If MCP4H works here â€” high-stakes, high-speed, or universally familiar â€” it can work anywhere.

## Why not just use existing tools?

- **Otter / Rewind**: capture everything â†’ you dig through haystack later.  
- **CrewChief / AI racing coaches**: analysis for experts.  
- **MCP4H**: translation into *human-friendly cues* in real time.  
  Clearer, not more.
