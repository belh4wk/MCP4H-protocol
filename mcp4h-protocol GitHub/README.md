# MCP4H – Multimodal Communication Protocol for Humanity

**MCP4H** is an open exploration into the future of communication:  
a universal, human-first protocol combining **Text, Audio, Visuals, and Haptics**  
into a resilient "4-Point Belt" for understanding.  

This repo serves as a working space for the **manifesto, whitepaper, and technical exploration** of MCP4H.

## 🌍 Vision
Humanity’s greatest challenge is often **miscommunication**.  
MCP4H aims to create a foundation where meaning can travel across:
- Languages
- Cultures
- Modalities (voice, text, visual, haptic)
- Eventually, between **humans and machines**

Our goal: **clarity, empathy, speed, and trust** — built into a shared protocol,  
just as the 3-point seatbelt became a universal safety standard.
