# Disclaimer

This document provides important context regarding the MCP4H‚Ñ¢ (Multimodal Communication Protocol for Humanity) project and its preprints, publications, and repository materials.  

---

## üìå Context
MCP4H‚Ñ¢ is currently at the **early research and exploratory stage**.  
The repository, preprints, and supporting documents (Manifesto + Whitepaper) are intended for **community review, discussion, and collaborative development**.  

As such:
- Documents may be revised frequently as the project evolves.  
- Current releases (v0.x) represent **drafts and exploratory versions**.  
- Later stable/public releases (v1.0+) will be aligned with accepted standards and peer-reviewed venues.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- **MetaArXiv Submission (v1.0 Preprint)**  
  The initial uploaded PDF may display formatting issues (e.g., corrupted characters in some viewers).  
  ‚Üí This is a rendering artifact on the preprint server, **not present** in the original or GitHub-hosted PDFs.  

- **Versioning Differences**  
  Zenodo, OSF, and GitHub may reference slightly different versioning formats (e.g., `clean`, `v0.1-alpha`).  
  All are synchronized for **traceability**, but GitHub is the authoritative source for file names and changelogs.  

---

## üîÑ Resolution Plan
- Updated/corrected files are always uploaded to the GitHub repository under `/Docs`.  
- Any preprint servers (OSF, arXiv, HAL, etc.) will be updated with corrected versions as moderation cycles allow.  
- For citation purposes, **always reference the DOI** provided in `README.md` and `CITATIONS.md`.
