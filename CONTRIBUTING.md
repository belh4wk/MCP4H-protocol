This project is an open exploration into the future of communication, and community input is vital.

## üåç How You Can Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use the **Issues** tab to report bugs, suggest improvements, or ask questions.
- Be clear and descriptive; include steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Use labels where possible (`bug`, `enhancement`, `discussion`).

### 2. Proposing Enhancements
- Open an **Issue** first to start a conversation.
- Explain *why* the change matters, not just *what* it is.
- If you have an idea for implementation, feel free to sketch it.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
- Keep PRs focused: one issue/feature per PR.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Update documentation if your changes impact users.

### 4. Writing Examples
MCP4H will live or die by its ability to show real-world use cases.  
Contributions to the `/examples` folder are especially welcome:
- Text translation scenarios
- Audio-to-text experiments
- Visual signal overlays
- Haptic feedback demos
