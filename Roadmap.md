# MCP4H Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the **Multimodal Communication Protocol for Humanity (MCP4H)**.  
Our goal is to create an **open, universal, human-first communication protocol** that unifies **Text, Audio, Visuals, and Haptics** into a shared layer of understanding ‚Äî across people, devices, and eventually, humans + machines.  

---

## üå± Phase 1 ‚Äî Foundations (Now ‚Üí 6 months)
- Publish **Manifesto** and **Whitepaper** drafts (‚úÖ done).
- Establish GitHub repo with governance files (LICENSE, CoC, Contributing).
- Build awareness via:
  - LinkedIn + social posts
  - Early newsletter(s) + thought pieces
  - Open discussion threads in repo (Discussions tab)
- Begin collecting community input (use cases, pain points, collaborators).
- Initial protocol design notes (structure, signaling types, data formats).

**Deliverables:**
- Manifesto + Whitepaper v1
- Public repo
- First release(s) tagged as exploratory drafts

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2 ‚Äî Prototype Layer (6‚Äì18 months)
- Define **specification draft**:
  - Signal types: Text, Audio, Visual, Haptic
  - Core metadata formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers, etc.)
  - Interoperability guidelines
- Build lightweight SDKs:
  - JS prototype for testing
  - API stubs for real-time translation + multimodal messaging
- Implement example apps:
  - Chat demo (text + emoji + audio cues)
  - Racing/sim-rig integration demo (haptics + visuals)
- Run small-group pilots (gamers, sim racing, global remote teams).

**Deliverables:**
- Draft spec (alpha)
- Demo apps
- Open feedback cycle

---

## üöÄ Phase 3 ‚Äî Expansion (18‚Äì36 months)
- Formalize **protocol standardization group** (align with IETF/W3C if possible).
- Build wider SDK coverage (Python, C#, C++).
- Develop integration modules:
  - Mobile apps
  - VR/AR overlays
  - Hardware peripherals (game controllers, haptic rigs, wearables)
- Partner outreach:
  - Gaming + sim racing companies
  - Hardware makers (AR/VR, haptics, displays)
  - Open-source communities

**Deliverables:**
- MCP4H v1.0 spec (stable draft)
- Multi-language SDKs
- Real-world pilot integrations

---

## üåç Phase 4 ‚Äî Human + Machine Bridge (36+ months)
- Explore integration with **AI agents** and **neural interfaces**.
- Develop **context-aware translation** (preserve nuance, emotion).
- Expand haptic vocabulary for emotional + collaborative signaling.
- Pursue recognition in standards bodies (ISO, ITU).
- Ensure open governance + accessibility remain core principles.

**Deliverables:**
- Advanced multimodal prototypes
- Expanded governance + standards adoption
- Case studies (e.g., racing, global teamwork, accessibility tech)

---

## üèÅ Long-Term Vision
The **seatbelt analogy** drives MCP4H:
- Universal ‚Üí anyone, anywhere
- Simple ‚Üí usable by humans + machines
- Open ‚Üí no paywalls, no walled gardens

If the 3-point seatbelt saved millions of lives, the 4-point communication belt could help save our ability to **understand each other**.
