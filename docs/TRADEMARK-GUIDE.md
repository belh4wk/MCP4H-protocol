# MCP4H™ Trademark Guide

This project uses the **MCP4H™** brand. Until registration completes, use **™**. Once registered, replace with **®**.

## Where to use “MCP4H™”
- Public-facing docs: README, overview, FAQ, guides, blog posts.
- Slide decks, press notes, release notes.
- CI step names / job names (safe).
- UI text and labels.

## Where *not* to inject “™” automatically
- Filenames, URLs, schema IDs, JSON keys, code identifiers.
- Package names or import paths.
- Anything that, if altered, would break a reference or link.

## Recommended process
1. Review this patch or the ready-made TM repo zip.
2. After merge, use MCP4H™ in public-facing content.
3. After registration, s/™/®/ in public-facing docs.

## Marking usage
- Before registration: **MCP4H™**
- After registration: **MCP4H®** (update docs accordingly)
