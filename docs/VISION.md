# MCP4H™ Vision

Humans miss signals. A lot.  
Sometimes we misinterpret them too.

The usual “fix” tools offer? More dashboards. More assistants. More noise.  
We don’t need more. We need clearer.

## The Grammar of Attention

Every MCP4H™ cue has four parts:

1. **Type** (Coach, Risk, Plan, State, Confirm)  
2. **Priority** (now, soon, later)  
3. **Channel** (light, haptic, text, audio, all)  
4. **Rules** (expiry + acknowledgement)

That’s it — a simple grammar.  
MCP4H™ acts as the **referee, not another player**: choosing what matters, how to say it, and making sure it lands.

## Why these proving grounds?

- **Conversations**: everyone knows messy comms. The Harmonizer GPT applies MCP4H™ live, distilling tangents into cues and nudging better habits.  
- **(Sim)Racing**: if a cue is missed, the cost is immediate. MCP4H™ translates telemetry into intuitive states anyone can act on — *tyre hot, tyre cold, brake fade risk*.

If MCP4H™ works here, it can work anywhere.

## Where this can go

- **Wearables**: nudge before stress derails focus.  
- **AR overlays**: strip cockpit clutter down to a few timely cues.  
- **Enterprise comms**: unify assistants into one loop instead of 15 silos.

The common thread: **fewer missed signals**.

## Folded insights (Manifesto + Whitepaper)

- **Manifesto theme**: signals are shared responsibilities; MCP4H™ offers common ground across teams, tools, and machines.  
- **Whitepaper theme**: technical framing of MCP4H™ as a publish/subscribe schema with normative rules, but always human-facing at the edge.  
- Both condensed here: clarity over volume, grammar over noise, shared language over fragmented silos.

## Tone

This isn’t world peace.  
It’s a **grammar**: a small, durable layer that makes signals clearer.  
If it helps in meetings and in racing, it can scale anywhere humans and machines need to align.
