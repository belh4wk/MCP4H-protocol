# FAQ

### Is this just another assistant or dashboard?
No. MCP4H is not an app. It’s a **protocol**: a way of structuring cues so they’re clearer and more consistent across contexts.

### How is this different from Otter, Rewind, or CrewChief?
- **Otter / Rewind**: capture everything, let you dig later.  
- **CrewChief / AI racing coaches**: provide analysis for experts.  
- **MCP4H**: applies a grammar in real time, translating into *human-friendly cues* anyone can immediately act on.

---

### Why conversations and racing?
They’re proving grounds:  
- Conversations = universal, everyone misses signals.  
- Racing = high-stakes + high-speed, missed cues have obvious cost.

If it works in both, it can work anywhere.

### What happened to the Manifesto and Whitepaper?
They’ve been folded into `VISION.md` and `overview.md`.  
This keeps one set of living docs, not competing versions.

---

### Is this production-ready?
No — still early days. Schemas and examples are live, a SimHub bridge is in progress, and the Harmonizer GPT is available for conversations.

---

### Is this trying to solve world peace?
No. MCP4H isn’t utopian. It’s pragmatic:  
**fewer missed signals → clearer decisions → better outcomes.**
